Windows Update Viewer (WUView) is an application that displays information about Windows Updates. WUView uses the Windows Update API and Windows event logs to display details of installed updates. Event log entries are associated with individual updates by using the "KB" number. If an update does not use a KB number, or it isn't presented in a consistent format, no event log entries will be displayed. See [known Issues](https://github.com/Timthreetwelve/WUView/wiki#known-issues) if you are using Windows 10.
